# LaTeX Citation Verifier

## Overview

Use this skill to audit citation-backed manuscript claims. The goal is not only
to confirm that a BibTeX key compiles, but to verify that the cited work exists,
that the repository bibliography is accurate, and that the paper actually
supports the claim made in the manuscript.

## Required Context

Follow local instructions first. Read the manuscript root, macro file, and
bibliography declared by `AGENTS.md` or `agent-profile.json` before interpreting
citation-backed text. Do not assume a fixed directory or bibliography name.

If the repository has `agent_workflows/checklists/citation_verification.md`,
read and follow it. Treat it as the local audit contract.

If local instructions require clickable DOI links, confirm that the configured
macro or bibliography style preserves those links in the compiled PDF.

## Workflow

1. Locate the cited claim.
   - Find the sentence, paragraph, equation, or section containing the citation.
   - Record `file:line`.
   - Paraphrase the exact claim being supported.
   - Classify it as background, equation attribution, method comparison,
     historical attribution, empirical result, definition, or related work.

2. Resolve citation keys.
   - Use `scripts/scan_citations.py` when helpful to list citation commands,
     contexts, and BibTeX entries.
   - Locate each key in the repository bibliography file.
   - Check for missing keys, duplicate keys, and obvious field omissions.

3. Verify paper reality and metadata.
   - Prefer DOI metadata from Crossref, Datacite, publisher pages, arXiv,
     official proceedings, library records, MathSciNet, or ZbMATH.
   - Compare title, authors, year, venue, volume, issue, pages, publisher, and
     DOI with the BibTeX entry.
   - Distinguish preprint metadata from final publication metadata when the
     source or claim differs.
   - If internet access is unavailable, say which metadata checks are pending
     and continue with local PDFs and BibTeX inspection.

4. Verify source support.
   - Prefer a local PDF in `references/pdfs/` or official full text.
   - For equation claims, inspect the cited equation, local definitions, and
     assumptions in the paper.
   - For prose claims, inspect the relevant section or paragraph; abstracts and
     citation snippets are not sufficient for technical support.
   - Record page, section, theorem, table, figure, or equation evidence.

5. Assign a verdict.
   - `supports`: the paper directly supports the manuscript claim.
   - `partially-supports`: it supports a weaker or narrower claim.
   - `related-only`: it is relevant background but does not support the claim as
     written.
   - `contradicts`: it says something materially different.
   - `not-verifiable`: paper text or reliable metadata could not be inspected.

6. Edit only after evidence is clear.
   - If the claim is unsupported, revise the claim or recommend a replacement
     citation.
   - If metadata is wrong, patch the declared bibliography without changing manuscript prose
     unless the source evidence also changes the claim.
   - If the PDF is missing and support cannot be verified, report the gap rather
     than guessing.

## Reporting Format

Use this compact audit format:

```text
Claim: <file:line and short paraphrase>
Citation: <key>
Metadata: <pass/fail; DOI or missing DOI>
Evidence: <paper page/section/equation/table, with short paraphrase>
Verdict: <supports|partially-supports|related-only|contradicts|not-verifiable>
Action: <keep|revise claim|fix BibTeX|replace citation|add source|obtain PDF>
```

When multiple citations support one claim, report each key separately and then
state whether the combined citation set supports the claim.
